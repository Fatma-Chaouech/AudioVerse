## üöÄ Features and Challenges 

We're on a journey to create the ultimate audiobook experience with AudioVerse. While we've come a long way, there are still exciting features to be built and challenges to overcome. We believe in the power of community collaboration, and we invite you to join us on this adventure!

### üéüÔ∏è Features in the Pipeline

- **Enhanced Narrator Variety:** Elevate the storytelling experience by seamlessly switching between different voices, perfect for dialogues and diverse characters within the same audiobook.

- **Language Magic:** Expand language support to bring audiobooks to a global audience. Unleash the magic of storytelling in multiple languages!

- **Add File Parsers:** We currently support pdfs and txt files. We're working to enhance compatibility by adding support for additional file formats.

### üîç Challenges to Tackle 

- **Optimizing Audiobook Generation Pipeline:** The audiobook generation process takes a significant amount of time as the size of the book increases. We're exploring ways to optimize this process, whether by reducing the number of calls made to OpenAI and ElevenLabs or by experimenting with alternative models like Stability AI or Meta's models.

- **Enriching Sound Effects:** Currently, the accuracy of sound effect insertion varies due to a limited database. We're on a mission to create a comprehensive sound effects library, categorized by topics. Additionally, we're exploring the use of text-to-sound models to generate unique and accurate sound effects.

- **Enhancing Book Parsing:** We're exploring optimal methods for extracting the content from books, such as skipping elements like the table of contents.
